The consortium’s mission is to support software development communities to build free and open source publishing infrastructures.

The consortium is a network of businesses, community groups and researchers.

The consortium’s activities include; research and research publishing, software development, business development, advocacy, publishing, events and peer-learning.

The consortium is open to all areas of publishing. The current priority is interoperability between software platforms in scholarly publishing that are using multi-format and multimedia functionality.

The consortium is operated by the research organization the [Hybrid Publishing Group](https://hpg.io/).

### Connecting Platforms

The consortium supports an infrastructural backend software ecology to connect publishing platforms to enable — continuous validation, real-time processing, multi-format outputs and multimedia features.
 
The objective is to promote design excellence in — authoring systems, publication layout and interface design, librarianship and engineering — to enable diverse and global communities in the pursuit of knowledge creation and dissemination.

Key to the infrastructural approach is a notion of a universal fluid document model based on format transformation aligned to output requirements, rather than fixed format standards. The fluid document model is then combined with a test-driven methodology combining continuous validation and technologies including real-time processing, cryptographic IDs, flat-file storage, Docker virtualisation, encrypted documents and content distribution network APIs.

The goal of the infrastructure is to create a new synthesis of computational automation and human skills and agency, adding next-gen reliability and speed to publication production. In turn this new synthesis will change the use and control of knowledge institutions and industries.
